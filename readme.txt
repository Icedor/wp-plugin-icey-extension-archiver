Securely archive inactive plugins to prevent security risks and avoid WordPress warnings. Restore anytime with a single click.

== Description ==  

WordPress warns about inactive plugins because they can pose security risks if left outdated. **Icey - WP Plugin Archive Manager** helps you mitigate this by moving inactive plugins to a **secure archive folder**, keeping them isolated from WordPress while still available for later use.  

With a dedicated **admin tab**, you can easily restore archived plugins whenever neededâ€”without cluttering your active plugin list or compromising security. 

== Installation ==  

1. Find the plugin in the WordPress repository or upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`.  
2. Go to the **Plugins** page in your WordPress admin and activate the plugin.
